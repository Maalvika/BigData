"Benq Dc C1050 100 Mega Pixels Digital Camera"	"Menus and controls are very simple to use and the camera would be ideal for a first time digital camera user, although menus have to be backed out of completely before returning to the shooting screen, which can be time consuming and slightly annoying. The zoom rocker is easy to use and provides a smooth zoom movement between telephoto and wide-angle shots.\nBenQ DC C1050: Specifications  Sensor: CCD - 10.1Mp Zoom: 3x optical, 4 x digital Image Size: 3648 x 2736 Lens: f/7.94 - 22.71 Focus: TTL Auto Focus range: Normal: 40cm - infinity, Macro: 10cm Metering: Center, Multi, Spot ISO Sensitivity: Auto, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000 White Balance: Auto, Sunny, Cloudy, Tungsten, Fluorescent_H, Fluorescent_L, MWB Scene Modes: Landscape, Backlight, Night Scene, Snow, Fireworks, Building, High ISO Portrait, Food, Text, Kids, Sunset. Macro: 10cm Monitor: 2.4in TFT LCD Movie Mode: Yes Storage: 9Mb Internal, SD Batteries: 2 x AA Video Output: Yes Size/Weight: 91.5 x 61.5 x 26mm - 140g Transfer: USB 2.0\nBenQ DC C1050: Modes and Features The program mode of the DC C1050 offers quite a lot of control allowing the user to change the aperture and shutter speed of the camera, resolution, image quality, metering mode, white balance, ISO, exposure drive mode, AEB (Auto Exposure Bracketing), highlight areas, sharpness and effect (phew!). Then there is a movie mode as well as a Shake Free setting which works to reduce blur caused by camera movement by selecting a higher ISO setting in low light conditions. Scene modes offered here include Landscape, Backlight (changes metering for backlit subjects), Night Scene, Snow, Fireworks, Building, High ISO Portrait, Food, Text, Kids, Sunset and a Voice Recording option. One thing I did find slightly odd was that there was no 'regular' portrait mode, just a high ISO portrait mode for use in low light conditions. When I actually took a shot with this function the camera selected an ISO of 100 - hardly high at all.\nAvailable white balance options include Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Tungsten, Florescent_H, Florescent_L, and a custom white balance for accurate settings when light source cannot be specified. I found this to be a good feature as white balance presets are not always accurate. Metering modes offered are the regular Centre, Multi and Spot and the ISO settings range from 50 to 1000 and of course an auto ISO option. Another thing I found very strange here is that the EXIF data of the shot taken at ISO1000 actually shows ISO1030. The sharpness menu allows the user to select from Hard, Normal or Soft when in Program Mode, and there is a macro mode offered here but this only focuses from within 10cm, which I found quite disappointing judging by the fact that macro photography is supposed to be close-up.\nBenQ DC C1050: Build and Handling  The DC C1050 is very basic in design, with square features, a plastic outer casing and mock-leather strip down the left hand side. The lens is chunky and very prominent giving the camera a slightly retro feel. The camera feels extremely lightweight and slightly on the cheap and plasticky side. On the top of the camera is a small on/off button and a large chunky shutter release. On the back is a small zoom rocker, playback button, menu button, control joypad, delete function and mode selection."	"Unavailable"	NaN	1.3166666666666667	0.0

"Mount Baker and Boulder River Wilderness Areas [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest] (National Geographic: Trails Illustrated Map #826) (National Geographic Maps: Trails Illustrated)"	" • Waterproof • Tear-Resistant • Topographic MapMount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest • Washington, USAOne of five new Trails Illustrated maps for the Washington Cascades region offering the most detailed and up-to-date map for the forest, carefully researched and developed in co-operation with local land managers and agencies. Each map contains easy to read trails, numbered forest service roads, campsites, access points, scenic points-of-interests, and important facilities.Three narrow spires--North, Middle, and South Peaks--known collectively as Three Fingers anchor the center of Boulder River Wilderness. Boulder River, the primary drainage, runs northwesterly from a north-south ridge that rises to a high point of 6,850 feet on South Peak.Mountain climbers flood onto Mount Baker Wilderness Area in spring and summer before fall opens numerous large crevasses. Hundreds of climbers may be seen on the mountain in a single day. The Heliotrope Ridge Trail winds 2.7 miles to the Coleman Glacier, the most popular climbing route on the mountain. A well-developed and very busy trail system provides access to the lower country.Like all Trails Illustrated maps our new Washington Cascades titles are both highly durable and environmentally friendly. Each map is printed in the United States, at a certified green printer, using low V.O.C. inks on waterproof, tear-resistant material. Proceeds from the sale of Trails Illustrated Maps go to support the National Geographic Society's nonprofit mission to increase global understanding and promote conservation of our planet through exploration, research, and education.Coverage includes:Noisy Diobsud Wilderness Area, Mount Baker National Recreation Area, Skagit Wild and Scenic River, Mount Baker, Mountain Loop and North Cascades Scenic Byways Wilderness Coverage: Mount Baker, Boulder River, Noisy DiobsudOther Attractions: Mount Pilchuck and Wallace Falls State Parks, Baker and Spada Lakes, Lake Shannon, Hiking Trails, Mountain Biking, Scenic Back Roads, Boat Ramps, Mountain Climbing, Sno-Parks, Ski Areas, Fishing, Snowmobile Trails, Cross-Country Skiing, Waterfalls, Day Use Areas, Dispersed Camping Areas, Picnic Areas, CampgroundsFolded Size = 4.25 x 9.25Sheet Size = 25.5 x 37.75Scale = 1:75,000"	"Unavailable"	5.0	1.0153846153846153	5.076923076923077

The COOLPIX S9400 features a 18x zoom NIKKOR lens that takes you from wide-angle group shots to telephoto close-ups in an instant.

You won't have to interrupt a moment to capture it, and your photos and HD videos will look more natural and true to your memory.

Of course, when the lighting is extremely poor and you need a flash, it'll be there.\nSure to turn heads, the COOLPIX S9400 sacrifices nothing for a sleek, stylish design. Packed inside its pocket-sized body is a powerful 18x zoom super-telephoto NIKKOR glass lens with lens-shift Vibration Reduction and Motion Detection. Both of these features are designed to help you take astonishing close-ups that are razor-sharp, even if your hands are a bit unsteady or your subject is moving fast. Its large 3.0-inch 614,000-dot OLED display features Clear Colour Display technology and an anti-glare coating for easy viewing, even in direct sunlight. And with an 18.1-megapixel low-light CMOS image sensor, you can shoot without a flash in most low-light situations and enlarge your favourite shots to poster size! Wherever you go, slip the COOLPIX S9400 into your pocket and collect striking memories.\nCreate truly exceptional photos and HD videos with the COOLPIX S9400. Its high-performance NIKKOR glass lens is paired with a 18.1-megapixel CMOS low-light image sensor for superior image quality, versatility and low-light performance. Your shots will impress even you.\nIf you want a compact camera that shoots stunning Full HD videos, the COOLPIX S9400 delivers. 1080p Full HD means exceptional video quality.

"Nikon D300 inBrief Laminated Reference Card"	" The Nikon D300 comes with many controls and settings that allow you to capture the perfect exposure. Remembering where they are and exactly how they work together is a difficult, if not impossible task.    You can carry the user manual in your bag, but it s over one hundred pages long. Finding the answer to your question can be a frustrating experience.     The inBrief camera reference card is a laminated, foldable guide that answers most camera operation questions quickly and easily. The information is arranged logically so you can find the answer to you question in the shortest time possible.     Each inBrief card shows an annotated line drawing of the camera and an index to the information on the other panels. If you have a question about white balance, simply look at the purple panel. Answers to custom settings are always on the green panel.     The inBrief card has laminated hinges so the card lies flat. When folded, the dimensions are 5.5 inches by 4.25 inches. It fits neatly in the outside pocket of your camera bag for instant access.     Each card is subdivided into eight subjects across twelve color-coded panels. An overview of the information on each panel is listed below.   Teal: Annotated line drawing and general index Blue: Viewfinder, Control panel, and Monitor displays Red: Camera functions by exposure mode and flash information Lime: Focus, Drive Modes, and Self-Timer Yellow: Exposure, Metering, Bracketing Purple: White Balance, ISO, Image Size / Quality Orange: Displaying Images, Resetting the camera,   Live View Green: Custom Settings     Each card is professionally printed on 10 point card stock and laminated on each side for long wear and protection from the elements.
